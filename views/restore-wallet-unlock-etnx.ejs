                        <p>Sometimes, your funds will become stuck - you will have some locked funds that never become unlocked. This is how you fix it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Load your wallet in electronero-wallet-cli.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Type</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>adresss

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>viewkey

<p>into the electronero-wallet-cli command prompt. One at a time. Write down your public address, secret viewkey, and secret spendkey, if you haven't already. This is the best way to make sure you always have access to your Electronero wallet in the future.</p>

<p>First before you move ahead to restore your wallet address, try and use the command "sweep_unmixable".</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sweep_unmixable
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>sweep_unmixable allows you to 'get rid' of outputs in your wallet which have strange amounts like 0.000006839355, 
and are unmovable without combining them with another output. However, they are unmovable only if they are non-RCT or came before the 2nd hard-fork. 
Chances are, new users will never have to use this command.

First, let's retain an explanation by JollyMort's and below is an excerpt of his outlook on unmixable outputs <a href="https://monero.stackexchange.com/a/3517">(source)</a> and why they're 'unmixable' in the first place.

Your balance is made up of outputs of various amounts which you've received in the past. 
Every time you send, some of those get combined together until you reach some amount, which is then sent to the destination, and some change returned to your wallet.

Think of outputs as bills: you received a bill of 40 and 100 in the past, and now you want to pay something worth 120. Your wallet 'burns' the 100+40 bills, creates new bills of 120 and 20, sends the 120 to your recipient and returns the 20 to yourself and you're left with the bill of 20, plus whatever else you already had in the wallet. 
In Electronero, just like it's parent Monero, these 'bills' can now be created with any amount (pre-RCT, they had to be round numbers like 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 ...).

Thing is, like Monero, Electronero combines multiple outputs in a ring-signature, effectively hiding the one actually getting spent among other outputs found in the ring signature. 
Now, with RCT, you can pick any output for the ring signature because all the amounts are hidden. 
Before, you had to choose other outputs of the exact same value. This required splitting any amount into multiple outputs 
with common denominations, but there were always some of them which were unique, like 0.000006839355. There's simply 
no other like it, so there are no other outputs among which it could hide, and it would have to get spent alone. It's a special 
case which doesn't benefit from applying ring signatures and thus the special treatment. Because of this, you'd only want to use 
it once to join it with other outputs. The sweep_unmixable command is there to get rid of those special outputs once and for all 
(if you actually have them in your wallet, that is).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sweep_unmixable

<p>You should see something similiar to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wallet password:
Sweeping 600.00 for a total fee of 100.00.  Is this okay?  (Y/Yes/N/No):</li>
</ul>
<p> You may be prompted to pay a Network Fee at this time, should you submit (Yes) your unmixable outputs would be gathered into one transaction.
Submitted to the blockchain, and you will receive your mixable outputs less any actual Network Fee at the time, in the wallet you issued the "sweep_unmixable" order.

<ul>
  <li>Close electronero-wallet-cli by typing</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>exit

<ul>
  <li>Backup all of your wallet related files. These include:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>yourwalletname.bin
yourwalletname.bin.keys
yourwalletname.bin.address.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can be done by copying the files to a new folder.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when creating your wallet, you might have named it something without the .bin part. In that case, the wallet file will be called yourwalletname without the .bin at the end.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Delete yourwallet.bin</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Load electronero-wallet-cli, this time with your new wallet name and the restore flags --restore-from-keys type in the name of the wallet you just deleted. </br>On Main Net it should look like</p>
  </li>
  
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./electronero-wallet-cli --restore-from-keys yourwalletname
</code></pre></div></div>

  <li>
    <p>If you're on testnet . . .</br>It should look like</p>
  </li>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./electronero-wallet-cli --testnet --restore-from-keys yourwalletname
</code></pre></div></div>

  <li>
    <p>If you're on stagenet . . .</br>It should look like</p>
  </li>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./electronero-wallet-cli --stagenet --restore-from-keys yourwalletname
</code></pre></div></div>

  <li>
    <p>Enter address, private viewkey, private spendkey and a new password. The wallet will now refresh and hopefully your locked funds will now become unlocked as your outputs are scanned on the blockchain.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
